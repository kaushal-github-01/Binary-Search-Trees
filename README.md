# Binary-Search-Trees

An implementation of a binary search tree data structure written in JavaScript.

Includes the following methods:

1. insert(value) - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
2. remove(value) - removes the node holding the given value from the tree
3. find(value) - returns the node holding the given value in the tree
4. levelOrder() - traverses each node of the tree in level order
5. inorder() - traverses each node of the tree inorder
6. preorder() - traverses each node of the tree preorder
7. postorder() - traverses each node of the tree postorder
8. height() - returns the height of a node -- defined as the longest path between the node and a leaf node
9. depth() - returns the depth of a node -- defined as the distance between the node and the root
10. isBalanced() - returns true/false based on whether or not the tree is balanced
11. rebalance() - rebalances the tree
12. prettyPrint - prints the tree in the console in a human reader friendly format

Also included is a small script that tests most of the tree's functionality.
